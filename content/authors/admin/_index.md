I am a third year PhD candidate in computational biology at <a href="https://www.wzw.tum.de/index.php?id=2&L=1">School of Life Sciences</a> in
<a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a> under supervision of <a href="https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/institute/staff/staff/ma/2494/index.html">Fabian Theis</a>.
My PhD is focused on developing machine learning tools to analyze single-cell genomic data.
 
My main focus is leveraging single-cell technology and machine learning for Biomedicine and drug discovery. In the first year of my PhD, I developed 
<a href="https://github.com/theislab/scgen">scGen</a> a tool to analyze and  predict the effect of a perturbation (i.e drug, disease) at single-cell
resolution. To learn more about the the model, you can check our paper in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0494-8">Nature Methods</a> 
and media coverage in  <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/details/35624/">TUM</a> website. I am also a huge advocate of using ML to facilitate single-cell analysis for every one,
 regardless of their stat or ML knowledge. I developed a frame work 
called  <a href="https://github.com/theislab/scarches">scArches</a> leveraging transfer learning to create, share and integrate new datasets in to existing references.


Apart from academic research, I performed consulting for drug discovery companies such as <a href="https://cellarity.com/">Cellarity</a>.
I am also collaborating with <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/">Facebook AI</a> centered around machine learning for health and recently admitted to FACEBOOK AI research intern program.


Before starting my PhD, As a part of my master thesis thesis, I developed 
 <a href="shorturl.at/kCSZ4">Deep packet</a>, the first end-to-end model to
replace classical rule based approaches for traffic classification. The model was favoured by
The research community and has been cited 150 times since 2019!
