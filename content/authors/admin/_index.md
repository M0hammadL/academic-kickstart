I have recently finished my PhD in Computational Biology (summa cum laude) at <a href="https://www.wzw.tum.de/index.php?id=2&L=1">School of Life Sciences</a> in
<a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a> under supervision of <a href="https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/institute/staff/staff/ma/2494/index.html">Fabian Theis</a>.
 
I am interested intersection of AI and Biology and specifically leveraging single-cell technology for 
therapeutic applications and drug discovery. Check my <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=NXhouUcAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> and  <a href="https://twitter.com/MohammadLotfol1">Twitter</a> account for
latest update.


I also have industry experience as research intern and consultant in both drug discovery companies and machine learning research such as <a href="https://cellarity.com/">Cellarity</a> and <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/">Facebook AI</a>.
