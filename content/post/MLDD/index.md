Our paper titled  [Predicting single-cell perturbation responses for unseen drugs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Wz9OtQYk_A) 
is accepted as spotlight talk at MLDD 2022. This paper augments my previous work [CPA](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.14.439903v2)
with a molecular representation to predict unseen drugs. We additionally devised 
a transfer learning approach to leverage Bulk RNA-seq data to compensate for scarce data problems at the single-cell level.
