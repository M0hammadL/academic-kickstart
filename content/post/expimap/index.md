Excited to share our new approach, [expiMap](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.05.479217v1), to learn gene programs (GP) activity from single-cells "biologically informed deep learning".We add prior knowledge while learning new cellular circuits, 
going beyond data integration and towards interpretability.
