Proud that our paper on life-long and transfer learning for single-cell biology has 
been awarded among top 3 papers selected by anonymous reviewers 
from [MDSI](https://www.mdsi.tum.de/en/mdsi/latest-info/news/full-text/article/awardees-of-the-mdsi-best-paper-of-the-year-award/) at Technical University of Munich. 
This was among the work done during my doctoral studies at
Helmholtz Munich and Life science school at TUM.
