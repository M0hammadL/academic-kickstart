Our paper titled  [Predicting single-cell perturbation responses for unseen drugs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Wz9OtQYk_A) 
is now accepted as at NeurIPS 2022. In this we add chemical graph encoder to my previous work [CPA](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.14.439903v2) to predict gene expression response to unseen drugs not observed during training.
We additionally devised a transfer learning approach to leverage Bulk RNA-seq data to compensate for scarce data problems at the single-cell level which
improve the prediction accuracy. Congrats to all collaborators.
