 I am excited to announce the first spatial reference mapping in scArches powered by SageNet to map dissociated single cells scRNAseq into a common coordinate framework 
 using one or more spatially resolved reference datasets. 
 Try the tutorials [here](https://scarches.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SageNet_mouse_embryo.html).
SageNet is a robust graph neural network approach that maps scRNaseq datasets to their hypothetical tissue of origin predicting the spatial cell-cell distances for the query cells.
